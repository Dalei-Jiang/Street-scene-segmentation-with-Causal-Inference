# Program outline
  In this program, I am trying to use the causal inference to increase the accuracy of the image accuracy, and answer some Visual Commonsense Representation problems with improved Mask R-CNN with causal inference. 
  In recent years, classical machine learning is blamed for only finding the association between the variables, and some relations AI determines are not exactly helpful for the increasing the training accuracy. Therefore, "Causal Inference" becomes more and more significant in the machine learning field.
  My task is using the causal inference to remove the confounder in the image to increase the segmentation accuracy, and we have built the confounder dictionary to helo us construct the Baysian network.
